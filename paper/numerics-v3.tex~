\section{Introduction}

The statistical properties of zeros and central values of L-functions have been extensively studied, computationally, heuristically and analytically.  A fruitful approach to studying these statistical properties has been to associate the statistics of an ensemble of matrices from a classical matrix group to the statistics of values of an L-function (or a collection of L-functions).  For instance, Montgomery \cite{montgomery} famously conjectured a formula for the pair correlation of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function that is the same as formulas for the pair correlation for the eigenvalues of random matrices taken from either the Circular Unitary Ensemble or the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble if one takes the limit as the matrix size goes to infinity.  Odlyzko \cite{odlyzko} carried out massive computations of zeros of the Riemann zeta function to verify this conjecture.  Bogomolny and Keating \cite{bogomolnykeating1,bogomolnykeating2} provided heuristic evidence that not only the pair correlation functions agree, but all the n-point statistics do, as well.  Finally, Rudnick and Sarnak \cite{rudnicksarnak} proved that the Riemann zeros and the eigenvalues of this random matrix ensemble have the same n-point statistics in a restricted range.  

After studying the relationship between the zeros of the zeta function and the eigenvalues of random matrices, analogous work was done with other L-functions and matrix groups.  In particular, inspired by the work of Katz and Sarnak \cite{katzsarnak}, collections of L-functions could be placed in families and those families could be associated to matrices from classical matrix groups.  Moreover, in this cases it appeared that zeros of the L-functions have the same statistics as the eigenvalues of a randomly chosen matrix from the group, at least up to the leading term.  After the work of Katz and Sarnak there quickly appeared many examples of L-functions families behaving in a manner predicted by random matrix theory. Some of the families considered were: L-functions associated to holomorphic cusp forms (in either weight or level aspect); Dirichlet L-functions (either all or quadratic); and various twists or symmetric powers of L-functions. Analytic results about low-lying zeros were shown by Iwaniec, Luo, and Sarnak \cite{ils}, Rubinstein \cit{rub}, \"Ozl\"uk and Snyder \cite{os}, and others. 

In this paper we focus on families of quadratic twists of L-functions of holomorphic modular forms.  In particular, we want to understand the distribution of their low-lying zeros.  Miller~\cite[Figs. 3 \& 4]{miller06} observed that the first normalized zero above the central point of $L$-functions attached to rank-0 elliptic curves was repulsed from the central point. Due\~nez, Huynh, Keating, Miller, and Snaith record~\cite[Fig. 4]{DHKMS} a similar repulsion in the family of even quadratic twists of the elliptic curve $E_{11}$.  Also in \cite{DHKMS}, they consider an ``excised'' model in which, because of a zero free region near $s=1/2$ guaranteed by theorems of Waldspurger \cite{Waldspurger} and Kohnen--Zagier \cite{KZ}, they only consider eigenvalues above a certain cutoff.  They give explicit formulas for the size of the matrices to be used in both the ``standard'' and the excised models and the cutoff for the excised model.  In a recent preprint of Barrett and Miller \cite{bm}, similar analytic work is done for families of quadratic twists that do not correspond to the unitary group as families of twists of elliptic curves do.  In this paper, we numerically verify the conjectured formulas for these families.

The paper is organzied as follows.  In the next section, we give the necessary random matrix theory and L-function background and we summarize the main results in \cite{bm}.  In the subsequent section we describe the computations we carried out and the describe our results.



\section{Numerical Experiments}

In this section we perform preliminary experiments investigating whether there is similar repulsion if $E_{11}$ is replaced with either (i) a cusp form $f$ of weight $>2$ with trivial nebentypus, (ii) a cusp forms $f$ with complex multiplication by its own nontrivial nebentypus ($f=\overline f$) or (iii) a cusp form $f$ with nontrivial nebentypus ($f\ne \overline f$). The L-function calculations were carried out in PARI/GP \cite{PARI} and the random matrix theory calculations were carried out in Sage \cite{sage}; the plots and statistics were done in R \cite{R}.  The random matrix theory calculations were based on the algorithms in \cite{mezzadri}.  Our code is available at \cite{code}.  We use LMFBD labels \cite{lmfdb} to identify our forms.  

\subsection{Density Plots of Zeroes}

\subsubsection{Trivial nebentypus}\label{sec:repulsion1}
Fix $f$ to be a cusp form of level 3 and weight 8 (LMFDB label: \texttt{3.8.a.a}).  Let $d$ be an admissible discriminant as in \ncr{Definition 4} for $\chi_f$ principal; further assume that $L(1/2,f\otimes\psi_d)\neq 0$. We calculate the distribution of the lowest zero for $L(s,f\otimes\psi_d)$ for all $d < X$ for $X=40000$.  The basic statistics of the distributions are reported in Table~\ref{tbl:trivial} and density plots for the distributions are seen in Figure~\ref{fig:trivial}.  As expected, the center of the distribution shifts to the left as $d$ increases.

We have a cut off at $d = 24231$ because that $d$ corresponds to a change in the size of the corresponding matrices as well, from $N=8$ to $N=9$. }\label{tbl:trivial}

%, provided $L(1/2,f\otimes\psi_d)\ne0$.

%We also calculate the distribution of the lowest argument for $SO(2N)$ for $N=N_\text{std}$. We generated $455,000$ random $2N\times 2N$ orthogonal matrices and calculated the lowest positive argument.  As described earlier, for each discriminant $D$ in the family of L-functions, there is a corresponding $N_\text{std}$ that determines the size of the matrices of the corresponding group of random matrices.  For each discriminant in our data, we generated 50 random matrices of the corresponding size (we rounded to the nearest integer to find $N$ and then doubled it to ensure that we were considering an even orthogonal group).  The basic statistics of the distributions are reported in Table~\ref{tbl:so} and density plots for the distributions are seen in Figure~\ref{fig:so}.  As expected, the center of distribution shifts to the left as $N$ increases.

%\end{figure}

%\subsection*{Normalizing the data}  In order to show that the distributions of zeros of L-functions and arguments of eigenvalues are similar, we did one further analysis.  In particular, we normalized the spacings between the zeros and the arguments so that the average spacing was 1.  For the zeros of the L-functions, this reduced to multiplying a zero of an L-function twisted by a character of discriminant $D$ by $\log(3D^2)/(2\pi)$ and for the arugments of the eigenvalues this reduced to multiplying the argument of a $2N \times 2N$ matrix by $N/\pi$.  The resulting summary of these normalized zeros can be found in Table~\ref{tbl:trivial-comp} and their histograms can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:trivial-comp}.

\subsubsection{Self-dual, non-trivial nebentypus}\label{sec:repulsion2}
Let $q=e^{2\pi iz}$, and let 
\begin{equation*} 
f(z)=q\prod_{n=1}^\infty(1-q^n)^3(1-q^{7n})^3.
\end{equation*}
Then $f$ is a cusp form and a newform of weight 3, level 7 with character $\chi=\left(\frac n7\right)$, and has Fourier coefficients that are all real (LMFDB label: \texttt{7.3.b.a}).
The construction of $f$ follows from a general construction of Shimura, and $f$ arises from a Hecke gr\"o\ss encharakter. Let $\mathcal{D}(X)$ be as in Definition 4, self-CM case, with the choice $\heartsuit=\pm 1$.  We calculate the distribution of the lowest zero for $L(s,f\otimes\psi_d)$ for $d < X$ for $X=40000$ and for each value of $\heartsuit$.  The basic statistics of the distributions are reported in Table~\ref{tbl:self-dual} and density plots for the distributions are seen in Figure~\ref{fig:self-dual}.  As expected, the center of the distribution decreases as $d$ increases.

\subsubsection{Non self-dual, primitive nebentypus}\label{sec:repulsion3}
Let $f$ be a primitive holomorphic cusp form of weight 2 and level 13 and with primitive  nebentypus that is not self-dual (LMFDB label: \texttt{13.2.e.a}).  Let $\mathcal{D}(X)$ be defined as in Definition 4 for $f\ne\overline f$.  We calculate the distribution of the lowest zero for $L(s,f\otimes\psi_d)$ for $d <X$ for $X=40000$ and $d\equiv\diamondsuit \pmod{13}$ .  The basic statistics of the distributions are reported in Table~\ref{tbl:nonself-dual} and density plots for the distributions are seen in Figure~\ref{fig:nonself-dual}.  As expected, the centers of these distributions decraease as $d$ increases.

%We also calculate the distribution of the lowest argument for $U(N)$ for $N=2N_\text{std}$. We generated $554,750$ random $N\times N$ unitary matrices and calculated the lowest positive argument.  As described above, each discriminant $D$ in the family of L-functions, there is a corresponding $N_\text{std}$ that determines the size of the corresponding group of random matrices.  For each discriminant in our data, we generated 50 random matrices of the corresponding size (we rounded to the nearest integer to find $N$ and then doubled it).

\subsection{Comparing with Random Matrix Theory predictions}

Now we turn from the raw data associated to twists of these three types of L-functions and to the comparison of these data with the corresponding data from random matrix theory.  In this section we do not concern ourselves with excising the model, we pick that up in the next section.

\subsubsection{Matrix groups calculations}
As explained in \ncr{Section 6.6}, just after Corollary 8, the L-functions corresponding to forms $f$ where $\chi_f$ is principal correspond to matrices in the group $\textrm{SO}(\text{even})$, forms $f$ that are self-dual and have non-principal $\chi_f$ correspond to matrices in $\textrm{U}(N)$ \ncr{even?} and forms $f$ that are not self-dual and have non-principal $\chi_f$ correspond to matrices in $\textrm{USp}(2N)$ \ncr{even?}.  We implemented an algorithm for each group in Sage; the algorithm is described in \cite{mezzadri}.  See Figure~\ref{fig:densities} for density plots of $100,000$ $50\times 50$ matrices from each group.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Trivial nebentypus}

Let $f$ be as in Section~\ref{sec:repulsion1}. Let $\mathscr{D}_f (X )$ be as in \ncr{Definition 4} for $\chi_f$ principal. We calculate the distribution of the lowest zero for $L(s, f \otimes \psi_d )$ for $d \in \mathscr{D}_f (X )$, provided $L(1/2, f \otimes \psi_d ) \neq 0$. We also also calculate the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue for $\textrm{SO}(2N_{\text{std}} )$ where $N_\text{std}$ for discriminants around $X$ is given by 
\[
N_\text{std} = \log\left (\frac{\sqrt{3}X}{2\pi e}\right ).
\]
In Figure~\ref{fig:exp1-comp} we show the same zeros as in Figure~\ref{fig:trivial} and a plot of the distribution for random matrices in $\textrm{SO}(8)$ since $N_\text{std}$ for $X \approx 40,000$ is $3.6\dots$. The plots have been normalized to as to have the same mean.  We observe that the match between the two distributions is pretty good.  In a later section we sample differently and get a better fit; see Section~\ref{sec:excise1}.

\subsubsection{Self-dual, non-trivial nebentypus} 

Let $f$ be as in Section~\ref{sec:repulsion2}. Let $\mathscr{D}_f (X )$ be as in \ncr{Definition 4} for $\chi_f$ non-trivial. We calculate the distribution of the lowest zero for $L(s, f \otimes \psi_d )$ for $d \in \mathscr{D}_f (X )$, provided $L(1/2, f \otimes \psi_d ) \neq 0$. We also also calculate the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue for $\textrm{U}(N_{\text{std}} )$ where $N_\text{std}$ for discriminants around $X$ is once again given by 
\[
N_\text{std} = \log\left (\frac{\sqrt{3}X}{2\pi e}\right ).
\]
In Figure~\ref{fig:exp2-comp} we show the same zeros as in Figure~\ref{fig:trivial} and a plot of the distribution for random matrices in $\textrm{U}(4)$ since $N_\text{std}$ for $X \approx 40,000$ is $3.6\dots$. The plots have been normalized to as to have the same mean.  We observe that the match between the two distributions is pretty good.

\subsubsection{Non-self-dual, non-trivial nebentypus} 

Let $f$ be as in Section~\ref{sec:repulsion3}. Let $\mathscr{D}_f (X )$ be as in \ncr{Definition 4} for $\chi_f$ non-trivial.

We also also calculate the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue for $\textrm{USp}(N_{\text{std}} )$ where $N_\text{std}$ for discriminants around $X$ is once again given by 
\[
N_\text{std} = \log\left (\frac{\sqrt{3}X}{2\pi e}\right ).
\]
In Figure~\ref{fig:exp3-comp} we show the same zeros as in Figure~\ref{fig:trivial} and a plot of the distribution for random matrices in $\textrm{USp}(8)$ since $N_\text{std}$ for $X \approx 40,000$ is $3.6\dots$. The plots have been normalized to as to have the same mean.  We observe that the match between the two distributions is quite good.

\ncr{Gustavo:  seg\'un lo que dice Gonzalo esta $f$ sí cumple KZ.  Él me escribió: Este es un ejemplo "famoso", es la primera cuya forma de peso 3/2 que
no se puede construir con matrices de brandt / álgebras de
cuaterniones definidas. O sea: K-Z y Waldspurger valen en este caso,
pero la construcción que hacemos con series theta de formas
cuadráticas ternarias (definidas positivas) no funciona. Si hay un
interés particular por esta forma, habría que trabajar de otra manera
para encontrar la forma de peso 3/2 (por ejemplo, multiplicarla por
una de peso 1/2, determinar la de peso 2 resultante, calcularla, y
dividir -- como hacen Poor y Yuen con las paramodulares -- obviamente
va a ser más lento).  No sé si te interesa esto pero lo podemos hablar el jueves.}

\subsection{Excising the model}

While the agreement of the low-lying zeros of L-functions and eigenangles of random matrices illustrated in the last section look pretty good, we would like to carry out an experiment related to the excised model described earlier.  In particular, we observe that by Waldspurger's theorem \cite{Waldspurger} and, more explicitly by the Kohnen--Zagier formula \cite{KZ} $L(f\otimes \chi_d, 1/2)$ is discretized.  In particular, suppose a modular form of weight 2 corresponds to $h=\sum c(n)q^n$ in the Kohnen plus space of weight 3/2, with $c(n)\in\mathbb{Z}$.  Then,
\[
L(f\otimes\chi_d,1/2) = \frac{\kappa_f c(\abs{d})^2}{\abs{d}^{1/2}},
\]
where $\kappa_f > 0$ depends only on $f$ and $g$ and not on $\chi_d$.  This means, for example, that if  $L(f\otimes\chi_d,1/2) < \kappa_f \abs{d}^{-1/2}$ then it is equal to zero.  And, moreover, it means that for the L-funcitons in the families we are considering (they are rank 0), we know $L(f\otimes\chi_d,1/2) > \kappa_f \abs{d}^{-1/2}$.  

In the previous sections, we freely sampled from the entire space of random matrices.  In this section we sample from a subspace.  In \cite{CF,CKRS,CKRS2,KS} it was shown that values of L-functions at the central point can be modeled using characteristic polynomials evaluated at the point 1.  So, in analogy with the values $L(f\otimes\chi_d)$ is not allowed to take on, we model rank 0 curves by discarding from our sample space all random matrices $A$ whose characteristic polynomial $\Lambda_A(z,N)$ is away from 0 when evaluated at $z=1$.  

In \ncr{Section 3}, it is shown that the cutoff will be of the form
\[
\abs{\Lambda_A(1,N)} \geq c_{\text{std}}\times\exp((1-k)N_{\text{std}}/2)
\]
and in this section we estimate the constant $c_{\text{std}}$ for each of the three cases and leave, for two of the three cases, the verification of whether or not our approximation matches the formula given in \ncr{(3.23)} for future work.  




\subsubsection{Trivial nebentypus}\label{sec:excise1}

In this section we consider forms of weights 4, 6, 8 and 10 \ncr{these weights?  others?} and study how well the low-lying zeros of their associated L-functions are modelled using the excised model.  In particular, we approximate the choice of $c_\text{std}$ and the calculate explicitly using \ncr{(3.23)}. See Table~\ref{tbl:forms} for the forms that we use.


\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|rrrrrr}
Weight & Label & $f$ & $g$ & $\kappa_f$ & \# coeffs & $\mathscr{L}_M(X,f)$\\\hline
4 & & & & & \\
6 & & & & &\\
8 & & & & &\\
10 & & & & &\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{A table of the forms $f$ for which we calculate $c_\text{std}$.  We report the form's LMFDB label, the first few coefficients of $f$, the first few coefficients of the Shimura lift $g$ of $f$, the constant $\kappa_f$ in the Kohnen-Zagier formula and the number of coefficients we can calculate for $g$.  We also report the local factor of the L-function at $M$, the level of $f$.}\label{tbl:forms}
\end{table}


To find the value of $c_\text{std}$ numerically, we proceed as follows.  Let $f$ be the form we are considering and suppose it is of level $N$.  Calculate as many central values of $L(f\otimes \psi_d, 1/2)$ as possible (see Table~\ref{tbl:forms}).  Let $N_\text{std}$ be the size of the group of random matrices used to model the zeros of $f$.  Let $c$ be a candidate value for $c_\text{std}$.  Then we calculate a sample of $10^{7}$ matrices $A$\ncr{I don't know that this will be enough} in $SO(2N_\text{std})$ such that $\Lambda_A(1,N_\text{std}) \geq c \exp((1-k)N_\text{std}/2)$ \ncr{Gustavo:  Todo esto se puede hacer f\'acilmente en R, las matrices, los polinomios caracter\'isticos, etc.}.  Then for this $c$ we compare the distibution of zeros and eigenangles.  In particular, we measure the agreement between the distribution of the central values and the distribution of the characteristic polynomials evaluated at 1 by averaging the absolute value of the difference between the cumulative distribution of the zeros and the cumulative distribution of the eigenvalues at a set of evenly spaced points.\ncr{Gustavo:  No s\'e si hace falta normalizar para que tengan el mismo medio o mediano}  See Figure~\ref{fig:wt4-graph} for what such a plot might look like.  See Table~\ref{tbl:results} for a summary of our results.


As further confirmation, we compute $c_\text{std}$ using the following formula:
\[
c_\text{std} \times \exp((1-k)N_\text{std}/2) := a_f^{-2}(-1/2)\delta_f \kappa_f \times \exp((1-k)N_\text{std}/2)
\]
where $\kappa_f$ is the constant in the Kohnen-Zagier formula, 
\begin{multline*}
a_f(m) = \left [\prod_p \left ( 1-\tfrac{1}{p}\right )^{m(m-1)/2}\right ] \\
\times \left [ \prod_{p \nmid M} \left( 1+\tfrac{1}{p}\right )^{-1}\left(\tfrac{1}{p} + \tfrac{1}{2}\left [ \mathscr{L}_p(p^{-1/2},f)^m + \mathscr{L}_p(-p^{-1/2},f)^m\right ] \right ) \right] \\
\times \mathscr{L}_M\left (\tfrac{\epsilon_f}{M^{1/2}},f\right )^m 
\end{multline*}
and 
\[
\sqrt{\delta_f} = \frac{\abs{\{ L(f\otimes\psi_d, s)\in \mathscr{F}_f: d\text{ prime}, L(f\otimes \psi_d , 1/2)=0\}}}{\sum^*_{d\text{ prime}} 2a_f(-1/2)\sqrt{\kappa_f}d^{(1-k)/4} h(\log d)}.  
\]
Here \ncr{eigenvalues are normalized by dividing by $p^{(k-1)/2}$}\ncr{in the paper there is a $+$ superscript on $\mathscr{D}$ and $\mathscr{F}$ sometimes}\ncr{I think $\chi_f(p)=1/p$}
\begin{align*}
\mathscr{L}_p(X,f) &= (1-\lambda_f(p)X+\chi_f(p)X^2)^{-1} \\
\mathscr{F}_f(X) &= \{L(f\otimes\psi_d, s): d\in \mathscr{D}_f(X)\}\\
\mathscr{D}_f(X) &= \{d \text{ fundamental}: 0<d \leq X\text{ and }\psi_d(M)\epsilon_f=+1\}\\
\mathscr{F}_f &= \lim_{X\to\infty} \mathscr{F}_f(X)\\
\sum^* &=  \text{ sum $d$ fundamental, prime such that $f\otimes \psi_d$ has an even functional equation},\\
h(N) &= 2^{-N}\Gamma(N)^{-1} \prod{j=1}^N \frac{\Gamma(N+j-1)\Gamma(j)}{\Gamma(j-1/2)\Gamma(j+N-3/2)}.
\end{align*}
